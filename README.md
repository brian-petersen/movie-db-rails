# Movie Database

Created for science fair project back in 2012. The original app was written in PHP and used bash scripts but has now been implemented in Ruby on Rails.

The database is populated from information in the IMDB and displayed in a graphical frontend. On the old system once the movie was selected a request would be send to a "Kiosk" machine to begin burning it to a rewritable disk.
